FOCUS
    Firstly, to find disgruntled employees running sniffers on their machine.

1.  Send a request [ICMP] with the following:
      a. destination IP address of a suspect machine
      b. wrong destination MAC address
    What this does:
      NIC in promiscuous mode will pass this request
      Suspect machine will reply
      NIC in non-promisc mode will drop this packet

2.  Write a host based detection system to do the following:
      a. Look for a local NIC in promiscuous mode
      b. Verify incoming packets are only destined for the local MACs
      c. Check exorbitant amount of network traffic/CPU activity
      d. Rate of packet loss is unusually high
    If any of the above found:
      a. Notify the sysadmin
      b. Send mail to sysadmin notifying him of discovery

3.  DNS test that does the following:
      a. Build DNS packet with invalid IP as source/dest
      b. Inject packet
      c. Sniff network for DNS lookups on those IPs
 
4.  MAC comparison with a whitelist
      a. Every access point knows the MACs associated with itself
      b. Every access point shares a global whitelist
      c. Compare associated MACs with whitelisted MACs

5.  Ping
